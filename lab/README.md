# Write Some Functions in Git branches

## Lab Workflow
1. Fork this repository!
2. Clone onto your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-201d59.git`
3. `cd` into this directory and create a new branch for each function: `git checkout -b feature-name`
4. Add your code
5. Add, Commit, and push to your feature branch!
6. Merge Your feature branch into your master branch on github.
7. When you are finished with all functions, and all branches have been merged into master:
  - Make a pull request to the class repository.
  - Submit a link to the Pull request on Canvas :)
